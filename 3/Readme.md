<!-- TASK 3
Problem Statement
Explain the difference between npm and npx using the create-react-app code example -->
npm stands for node package manager and install packages globally or locally.
example: npm install -g create-react-app create-react-app my-app

npx is node package executer and it runs packages without installing them globally.
example: npx create-react-app my-app
It is cleaner and always uses the latest version

npm is for package installation whereas npx is for one time execution
