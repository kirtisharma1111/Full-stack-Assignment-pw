/* 
Q1.Explain the DOM and its role in Web development.
DOM(Documen Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. When a web page is loaded, 
the browser creates a DOM of the page - a tree-like structure where every HTML element is an object.
It enables dynamic content changes e.g. changing text, hiding elements, etc.
It allows JS to interact with and manipulate HTML/CSS.
