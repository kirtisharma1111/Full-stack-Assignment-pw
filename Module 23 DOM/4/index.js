/*
Q4. Explain the purpose of the addEventListener method in JavaScript and how it facilitates event handling in
the DOM.
addEventListener() attaches an event handler to an event handler to an element.
It allows multiple handlers for same event.
It works with event capturing/bubbling.
It is better than inline HTML event handlers.
