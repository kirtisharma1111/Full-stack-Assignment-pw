<!-- TASK 1
Problem Statement
Q1. Explain the potential SEO challenges and solutions associated with Single Page Applications (SPAs). -->
Challenges:-
1.Client-Side Rendering: Content is rendered with JS in the browser. Search engine crawlers may not index dynamic content correctly.
2.No Unique URLs: SPAs often use JS routing, resulting in fewer indexable routes.
3.Meta Tag Issue: Meta tages like title and description might not update properly per page, affecting search ranking.
4.Slightly slow

Solutions:
1.Use Server-Side rendering by using tools like node.js
2.Prerendering
3.Dynamic meta tags
